Decision Tree
Gives the decision tree for TCP data classifying on normal flow, and identifying anomalies

Random Forest Tree is another way of classification. Currently the results show a poor overfitted example.

TSNE
The data is currently not avialable as this works with netflow.
Everyone is invited to use the code for their data
